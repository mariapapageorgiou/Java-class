public class GreatestCommonDivisor {

    // Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters of type int named first and second.
    // If one of the parameters is <10, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value. The method should
    // return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (int). The greatest common divisor is the largest positive
    // integer that can fully divide each of the integers (i.e. without leaving a remainder).
    // TIPS
    // 1. Use a while or a for loop and check if both numbers can be divided without a remainder.
    // 2. Find the minimum of the two numbers.
