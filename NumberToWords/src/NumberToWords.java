public class NumberToWords {

    // Write a method called numberToWords with one int parameter named number. The method should print out the passed
    // number using words for the digits. If the number is negative, print "Invalid Value".
    // To print the number as words, follow these steps:
    // 1. Extract the last digit of the given number using the remainder operator.
    // 2. Convert the value of the digit found into a word. There are 10 possible values for that digit, those being
    //    0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Print the corresponding word for each digit.
    // 3. Remove the last digit from the number.
    // 4. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the number is 0.

    // Write a second method called reverse. The method should have one int parameter and return the reversed number(int).
    // The method reverse should also reverse negative numbers.
    // Use the method reverse within the method numberToWords in order to print the words in the correct order.

    // Write a third method called getDigitCount. The method should have one int parameter called number and return the
    // count of the digits in that number. If the number is negative, return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

    // HINT: Use a for loop to print zeroes after reversing the number. To get the number of zeroes, check the difference
    //       between the digit count from the original number and the reversed number.
